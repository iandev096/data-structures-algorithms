Given a list of single numbers LIST, and you are able to perform a limited number of swaps on the numbers in this list. Let SWAPS be the number
of swaps that can be made. Write a function that takes LIST and SWAPS and returns LIST with the largest possible permutation.

For example given [1,2,3,4] and 2 swaps, the largest possible permutation is [4,3,2,1]
